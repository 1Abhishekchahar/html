        Tata Motors Limited is an Indian multinational automotive manufacturing company, headquartered in Mumbai, India,
        which is part of the Tata Group. The company produces passenger cars, trucks, vans, coaches, buses.[5]

        Formerly known as Tata Engineering and Locomotive Company (TELCO), the company was founded in 1945 as a
        manufacturer of locomotives. The company manufactured its first commercial vehicle in 1954 in a collaboration
        with Daimler-Benz AG, which ended in 1969. Tata Motors entered the passenger vehicle market in 1988 with the
        launch of the TataMobile followed by the Tata Sierra in 1991, becoming the first Indian manufacturer to achieve
        the capability of developing a competitive indigenous automobile.[6] In 1998, Tata launched the first fully
        indigenous Indian passenger car, the Indica, and in 2008 launched the Tata Nano, the world's most affordable
        car. Tata Motors acquired the South Korean truck manufacturer Daewoo Commercial Vehicles Company in 2004. Tata
        Motors has been the parent company of Jaguar Land Rover since the company established it for the acquisition of
        Jaguar Cars and Land Rover from Ford in 2008.

        Tata Motors' principal subsidiaries include British premium car maker Jaguar Land Rover (the maker of Jaguar and
        Land Rover cars) and the South Korean commercial vehicle manufacturer Tata Daewoo. Tata Motors has a
        construction-equipment manufacturing joint venture with Hitachi (Tata Hitachi Construction Machinery), and a
        joint venture with Stellantis which manufactures automotive components and Fiat Chrysler and Tata branded
        vehicles. On 12 October 2021, private equity firm TPG invested $1 billion in Tata Motors' electric vehicle
        subsidiary.

        Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Limited is a British luxury automobile maker which has operated as a wholly owned
        subsidiary of BMW AG since 2003 – as the exclusive manufacturer of Rolls-Royce-branded motor cars. The company's
        administrative and production headquarters are located on the Goodwood Estate in Goodwood, West Sussex, England,
        United Kingdom.

        From 1906 to 2003, motor cars were manufactured and marketed under the Rolls-Royce brand by Rolls-Royce Motors.
        The Rolls-Royce Motor Cars subsidiary of BMW AG has no direct relationship to Rolls-Royce-branded vehicles
        produced before 2003, other than having briefly supplied components and engines. The Bentley Motors Limited
        subsidiary of Volkswagen AG is the direct successor to Rolls-Royce Motors and various other predecessor entities
        that produced Rolls-Royce and Bentley branded cars between the foundation of each company and 2003, when the
        BMW-controlled entity started producing cars under the Rolls-Royce brand.

        The BBC called Rolls-Royce "probably one of the most recognised icons in the world", and that "the name
        Rolls-Royce entered the English language as a superlative."[3] A marketing survey in 1987 showed that only
        Coca-Cola was a more widely known brand than Rolls-Royce

        Mercedes-Benz (German pronunciation: [mɛɐ̯ˈtseːdəsˌbɛnts, -dɛs-] (listen)),[6][7] commonly referred to as
        Mercedes and sometimes as Benz, is a German luxury and commercial vehicle automotive brand established in 1926.
        Mercedes-Benz AG (a Mercedes-Benz Group subsidiary established in 2019) is headquartered in Stuttgart,
        Baden-Württemberg, Germany.[1] Mercedes-Benz AG produces consumer luxury vehicles and commercial vehicles badged
        as Mercedes-Benz. From November 2019 onwards, Mercedes-Benz-badged heavy commercial vehicles (trucks and buses)
        are managed by Daimler Truck, a former part of the Mercedes-Benz Group turned into an independent company in
        late 2021. In 2018, Mercedes-Benz was the largest brand of premium vehicles in the world, having sold 2.31
        million passenger cars.[8]

        The brand's origins lie in Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft's 1901 Mercedes and Carl Benz's 1886 Benz
        Patent-Motorwagen, which is widely regarded as the first internal combustion engine in a self-propelled
        automobile. The slogan for the brand is "the best or nothing".[9]

        Aston Martin Lagonda Global Holdings PLC is an English manufacturer of luxury sports cars and grand tourers. Its
        predecessor was founded in 1913 by Lionel Martin and Robert Bamford. Steered from 1947 by David Brown, it became
        associated with expensive grand touring cars in the 1950s and 1960s, and with the fictional character James Bond
        following his use of a DB5 model in the 1964 film Goldfinger. Their sports cars are regarded as a British
        cultural icon.[3] Aston Martin has held a Royal Warrant as purveyor of motorcars to the Prince of Wales since
        1982,[4] and has over 160 car dealerships in 53 countries, making it a global automobile brand.[5] The company
        is traded at the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index.[6] In 2003 it received the
        Queen's Award for Enterprise for outstanding contribution to international trade.[7] The company has survived
        seven bankruptcies throughout its history.[8]

        The headquarters and main production of its sports cars and grand tourers are in a 22-hectare (55-acre) facility
        in Gaydon, Warwickshire, England, on the former site of RAF Gaydon, adjacent to the Jaguar Land Rover Gaydon
        Centre.[9] The old 3.6-acre facility in Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire is the present home of the Aston Martin
        Works classic car department, which focuses on heritage sales, service, spares and restoration
        operations.[10][11] The 36-hectare (90-acre) factory in St Athan, Wales features three converted 'super-hangars'
        from MOD St Athan, and serves as the production site of Aston Martin's first-ever SUV, the DBX.[12][13] Aston
        Martin plans on building electric vehicles on both its Gaydon and St Athan factories by 2025
