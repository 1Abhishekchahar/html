                      <span>Throughout the Greek era of the series, Kratos is portrayed as a Spartan warrior, who becomes known as the "Ghost of Sparta" after accidentally killing his family due to the trickery of his former mentor Ares, the God of War. He later avenges the deaths of his family and becomes the new "God of War" after killing Ares.</span>

						Kratos is eventually revealed to be a demigod and the son of Zeus, who later betrays him. Kratos embarks on several adventures in attempts to avert disaster or to change his fate. He is usually portrayed as being oblivious to all else and is stoic, bloodthirsty, and arrogant in nature, often engaging in morally ambiguous activities and performing acts of extreme violence. However, he frequently questions himself, undergoes bouts of severe guilt and self-hate, even attempting suicide several times, and is generally portrayed as a tragic figure. Vengeance is a central theme of the Greek era, and installments focus on Kratos' origins and his relationships with his family and the Olympian gods. In the Norse era of the series, Kratos finds himself controlling his rage and learning how to truly be a father and mentor to his son, Atreus, helping him come to terms with his divinity. Along their journey, they combat monsters and gods of the Norse realm, of whom they make enemies, which inevitably leads to the catastrophic Ragnarök.
